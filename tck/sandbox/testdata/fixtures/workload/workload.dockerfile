# Each probe carries its mode on the COPY rather than earning it from a

# agent user, which cannot chmod what COPY laid down as root, so a build
# step would fail on every conforming base image.

# until timeout (28) map to blocked: both are policy mechanisms runtimes
# really use, and every deny assertion runs after an allowed-host probe
# succeeded in the same sandbox, ruling out a general outage. The residual
# ambiguity — the origin itself failing — is exactly an origin outage, and
# no probe against a public origin can see through that.

# The same observation for one HTTP request rather than a connection:
# `kit-tck-http-probe METHOD URL`. Exit 7 means the boundary answered 403,
# 0 means the request reached the origin, and anything else is a failure
# to observe either.
#
# Exit 7 is reserved for that 403 alone, because the capability page
# requires an HTTP refusal to carry it. Two weaker readings both pass a
# non-conforming runtime: counting every 4xx would accept the origin's own
# 404 or 405 from a runtime enforcing nothing, and counting a dropped or
# timed-out connection would accept a runtime that refuses by hanging up,
# which the page rules out precisely because the sandbox cannot tell it
# from a broken network. Any other status means the request got through,
# whatever the origin then made of it.
#
# Curl's own exit 7 (failed to connect) is remapped so it cannot be read
# as this probe's sentinel; 101 is outside curl's range.

# certify a runtime enforcing no HTTP policy at all. The residual is an
# origin that fails while policy is absent, which no probe against a
# public origin can see through.
# Exit 0: a completed response other than 403 — the boundary let the
# request through (the fixture paths do not exist at the origin, so origin
# content cannot be the through-signal here; a 404 is the origin's answer
# arriving). Exit 7: an observed 403, the refusal status the page
# requires; a boundary answering anything else satisfies no refusal
# assertion. Exit 101: connection refused. The one ambiguity — the origin
# itself answering 403 — is attributed by the same-method control probe
# each refusal check runs against an allowed host first: if that origin
# family 403s the method, the control fails loudly instead of certifying.

# A bare `bash` reads stdin, and the contract promises the adapter neither

# process-based runtime with an already-stopped sandbox and failing every
# exec check for reasons that have nothing to do with capabilities. The
# fixture waits instead, and waits without spinning.
# The suite's checks read the agent-context profile beside the workspace,
# so the workload pins its workdir where the contract says the suite will
# look: a runtime placing the profile beside the workload's own workdir
# writes it as this directory's sibling, which is exactly where the suite
# reads.
# The canary the inject-only check compares by value: the image owns it,
# so it is identical in every composition, and a runtime smuggling a
# credential into an existing variable is judged against a variable the
# suite controls rather than every stable name (runtime-owned variables
# may legitimately vary with the kit set).
